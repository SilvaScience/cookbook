Method:

In a large bowl of a stand mixer, combine bread flour and whole wheat flour. 

To the side, mix warm water (100F) with instant yeast. Mix thoroughly.

Using a dough hook attachment, mix on low speed while mixing in the yeasty water. Mix for 10 minutes. Scrape down the sides occasionally.

Add fine sea salt and switch to medium-low speed and mix for an additional 10 minutes. 

While mixing add in extra virgin olive oil and mix for an additional 3-5 minutes. 

Dump dough out onto a non floured work surface. Knead using the slap and fold method for about 2 minutes.

In a 3-4qt container, generously spray with oil along with a drizzle of olive oil. Toss the dough and cover with a greased lid. 

Place into the fridge for 48-72 hours. 

Grab a pan and spritz with spray oil along with a glug of olive oil. Carefully remove the dough onto the baking sheet. 

Gently stretch the dough to the edges. Cover with an inverted baking sheet, wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 3 hours.  

Preheat the oven to 500-550F. 

Using olive oil and any desired toppings, drizzle the top with oil and top with whatever spices or fillings desired. Za’atar and flaky salt used in the video.

Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.
