Ingredients :
- 450-500 g pasta of choice (about half a bag; if you make the whole bag, double up the sauce)
- water
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp flour (unbleached preferred)
- 1 cup milk (if using plant-based milk, may need to reduce quantity)
- 1 cup shredded cheese (optional; can add thickness if using plant-based milk)

1. Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan.
2. Once water is boiling, stir in pasta and reduce heat. Cook pasta according to package instructions.
3. Meanwhile, heat butter on medium-low heat in a small saucepan.
4. Once butter has melted, remove from heat and incorporate flour. Start with a smaller quantity of flour, and gradually stir in the rest. The texture should look a bit like applesauce, not too liquid or too thick.
5. Add milk and return to heat.
6. Stirring continuously, heat milk until it starts to thicken and large bubbles appear.
7. Remove sauce from heat and stir in cheese.
8. Drain pasta once done and serve with sauce.
