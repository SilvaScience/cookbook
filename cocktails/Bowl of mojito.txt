Ingredients :
- 20 fresh mint leaves
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 4 cups (1 liter) chilled club soda
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) dark rum
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) lime juice (about 4 to 6 limes)
- ice cubes
- lime wedges (optional; to serve)

1. With a mortar and pestle, crush the mint leaves with the sugar. Be careful not to completely destroy the mint leaves
2. In a bowl, combine the club soda, rum, lime juice and muddled mint and sugar. The bowl in place of a pitcher is essential; it's what makes you look like an unhinged alcoholic.
3. Put some ice cubes and 1 lime wedge in each glass. Ladle the mojito into the glasses. Serve immediately.
