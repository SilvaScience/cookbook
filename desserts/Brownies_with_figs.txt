Ingredients:

For the brownies:

    1 cup (175g) dried figs, chopped
    1/2 cup (120ml) hot water or brewed coffee (for soaking figs)
    1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted
    1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
    1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar
    2 large eggs
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    1/3 cup (30g) unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour
    1/4 tsp salt
    1/4 tsp baking powder
    1/2 cup (85g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks

Optional topping:

    Extra chopped figs or a drizzle of melted chocolate

Instructions:
Step 1: Prepare the figs

    Chop the dried figs into small pieces.
    Place them in a small bowl and pour hot water or brewed coffee over them. Let them soak for 10–15 minutes until softened. Drain and set aside.

Step 2: Preheat the oven

    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Grease an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking pan or line it with parchment paper.

Step 3: Mix the wet ingredients

    In a mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Whisk until smooth.
    Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition.
    Stir in the vanilla extract.

Step 4: Combine the dry ingredients

    In a separate bowl, sift together the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder.
    Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined. Do not overmix.

Step 5: Add figs and chocolate

    Gently fold in the soaked figs and chocolate chips.

Step 6: Bake

    Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.
    Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.
    Avoid overbaking to keep the brownies fudgy.

Step 7: Cool and serve

    Let the brownies cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes before cutting into squares.
    Top with extra chopped figs or drizzle with melted chocolate if desired.
