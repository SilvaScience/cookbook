Mint Tea Recipe

Ingredients:
- 1 handful of fresh mint leaves (approximately 10-12 leaves)
- 2 cups (500 ml) of water
- 1-2 teaspoons of honey or sugar (optional)
- 1 slice of lemon (optional)

Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Mint**:
   - Rinse the fresh mint leaves under cold water to remove any dirt or impurities.
   - Gently crush the leaves with your hands to release their natural oils.

2. **Boil the Water**:
   - Bring the 2 cups of water to a gentle boil in a kettle or saucepan.

3. **Steep the Tea**:
   - Place the mint leaves in a teapot, mug, or heatproof glass.
   - Pour the boiling water over the mint leaves.
   - Cover and let it steep for 5-10 minutes, depending on how strong you like your tea.

4. **Sweeten and Add Lemon (Optional)**:
   - If desired, stir in honey or sugar to taste.
   - Add a slice of lemon for a zesty flavor twist.

5. **Serve**:
   - Strain the tea into a cup if you prefer to remove the leaves.
   - Serve hot and enjoy!

For an iced version, let the tea cool down and pour it over ice cubes in a tall glass. Garnish with extra mint leaves for a refreshing presentation.
